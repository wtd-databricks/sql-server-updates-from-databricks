# Databricks Notebooks for SQL Server Updates

I’ve prepared two distinct Databricks notebooks to showcase how to handle updates from Databricks to SQL Server. Essentially, I spun up a SQL Server instance to connect to via Databricks and provided comments in the notebooks for you to follow along. Each is optimized for a specific scenario:

- **Handling updates less than 10 MB in size**
- **Handling updates greater than 10 MB in size**

Below, I'll delve into the rationale behind selecting different methodologies for each scenario, highlighting the benefits and considerations of each approach.

## For Updates Less Than 10 MB

For smaller updates, we’ve utilized a native Python approach with JDBC connectivity. This method is straightforward and effectively leverages the power of direct SQL execution for minor updates.

### Why Native Python with JDBC?

- **Simplicity**: 
  - Using native Python to execute SQL commands via JDBC is less complex and very direct, making it highly suitable for smaller datasets where the overhead of initializing Spark's distributed processing is unnecessary.
- **Performance Optimization**: 
  - For small volumes of data, the additional setup and execution time associated with Spark can outweigh its benefits. Direct JDBC connections provide a streamlined and efficient alternative.
- **Ease of Use**: 
  - Implementing updates through Python scripts is straightforward, offering a quick and easy solution for routine data modifications without engaging Spark's more complex data handling capabilities.

This approach capitalizes on direct JDBC connections for executing SQL `UPDATE` commands, as Apache Spark, by design, does not support direct database `UPDATE` operations within its DataFrame API. This method is particularly beneficial when dealing with small-scale updates, where simplicity and direct database interaction are paramount.

## For Updates Greater Than 10 MB

For larger data updates, we employed Spark to harness its robust data processing capabilities, writing intermediate results to a staging table in SQL Server. This was followed by a `MERGE` operation, facilitated by invoking a stored procedure within SQL Server that encapsulates the merge logic.

### Why Spark and a Staging Approach Invoked With A Stored Procedure?

- **Efficient Large Data Handling**: 
  - Spark excels in processing large volumes of data across distributed systems, significantly reducing the time and computational resources required for data preparation before updates.
- **Network Traffic Consideration**: 
  - Directly updating large datasets over JDBC can significantly impact network bandwidth and potentially lead to timeouts or errors due to the large volume of data transmitted. By utilizing Spark to aggregate and preprocess data before bulk writing to a staging table, we minimize network load and improve reliability. Invoking the Stored Procedure within SQL Server then ensures the majority of data processing doesn't happen over the network but within SQL Server itself.
- **Enhanced Reliability**: 
  - Writing to a staging table before executing a `MERGE` operation allows for a controlled environment to review and validate data before it’s merged into the main table. This step also reduces locking and contention on the main table, ensuring that other database operations are not adversely affected.
- **Scalability and Error Handling**: 
  - This method offers scalability as data volumes grow and provides a framework for comprehensive error handling and rollback capabilities within the stored procedure, ensuring data integrity and consistency.

The decision to process large updates in this manner stems from the need to efficiently manage network traffic and leverage SQL Server's strengths in handling complex `MERGE` operations. Spark's ability to distribute data processing tasks makes it an ideal choice for preparing large datasets. However, given Spark's limitations around executing `UPDATE` or `MERGE` operations directly, the use of a staging table and a SQL Server stored procedure offers a powerful and scalable solution to apply these updates.

These notebooks were crafted with the intention of streamlining your SQL Server update workflows, ensuring optimal performance and scalability regardless of the data size. I’m confident these strategies will mitigate the challenges you've faced and enhance your data update processes from Databricks to SQL Server.
